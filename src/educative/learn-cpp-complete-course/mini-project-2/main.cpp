/*
    In this game:
        - You are shown a number of blank lines representing a secret word, and you have to reveal the secret word by guessing letters correctly.
        - You can guess one letter at a time, and the game terminates after a certain number of incorrect guesses.
        - If you guess the letter that is present in the secret word, that letter is revealed in place of the blank.
        - If you guess the wrong letter, you lose one try, and some part of a person is drawn on the gallows.
        - After a certain number of incorrect guesses, a person will be hanged on the gallows, and the game is over.
    If you guess all the letters in the secret word before the man is hanged completely, you win!!

    First, letâ€™s begin by initializing the required global state for the game. You will need to define variables to represent the following:
        - Maximum number of guesses allowed (this can range from 5 to 10).
        - Number of guesses remaining (initially this is the same as the maximum number of guesses).
        - A variable to store the letter guessed by the player
        - A variable to store the word to be guessed
        - A variable to hold the length of the word to be guessed.
